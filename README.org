anki-editor -- an Emacs package that helps you create Anki cards in Org-mode

* Requirements
  - [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation][anki-connect]], an Anki add-on which is required for this package to
    interact with Anki.
  - curl

* Usage
  1. Download it and put it into your Emacs' =load-path=
  2. =(require 'anki-editor)=
  3. Write notes in org syntax, e.g. [[./examples.org][examples.org]]
     - Headings of deck are tagged with =deck=
     - Headings of note are tagged with =note=
     - Custom properties of a note heading can be used to specify note
       type and tags
     - Subheadings of a note heading are fields of its note type
     - The contents of field headings will be converted to html by
       org-mode's html backend, with the latex syntax translated to
       the Anki style
