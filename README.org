anki-editor -- Emacs minor mode for making Anki cards with Org

* Installation

  *Requirements*
  - [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation][anki-connect]],
    an Anki add-on required by this package to interact with Anki.
  - curl

  If you have [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] in your =package-archives=,
  just =M-x package-install RET anki-editor RET=, or install it
  manually by downloading and visiting [[./anki-editor.el][anki-editor.el]] in your
  emacs buffer, and =M-x package-install-from-buffer RET=.

* Usage

** The Layout of Notes

   Now you can compose Anki notes in Org syntax, e.g. lists, code
   examples, tables, embedded latex, when being submitted to Anki,
   they will be converted to HTML by Org-mode's HTML backend with
   specific markers (e.g. latex) translated to Anki style.

   The structure of a note is as follow, which is inspired by
   =org-drill=. More examples can be found in [[./examples.org][examples.org]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,* Idiom                                                        :vocab:idioms:
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ANKI_DECK: English
       :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic (and reversed card)
       :END:

     ,** Back
        it's raining very hard
   #+END_SRC

   - An Anki note is an Org entry with =ANKI_NOTE_TYPE= property
   - Anki tags are just Org tags [fn:1]
   - Other necessary information (e.g. deck, note type) of a note is
     put in the property drawer of the entry
     - As the value of =ANKI_DECK= is retrieved with inheritance, you
       don't have to set it per note, instead, you could create a deck
       entry with this property set and put note entries under it, or
       set it per file by ~#+PROPERTY: ANKI_DECK YourDeck~
   - Child entries of a note entry are fields

[fn:1] It should be noted that Org only allows letters, numbers, =_=
and =@= in a tag but Anki allows more, so you may have to edit you
Anki tags before they can be used in Org without any surprise.
